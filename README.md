SpykeTorch is a Pytorch-based simulator of convolutional spiking neural networks, in which the neurons emits at most one spike per stimulus. SpykeTorch supports STDP and Reward-modulated STDP learning rules. The current code is the earliest version of this simulator and unfortunatly is not very user-friendly and well-documented. Our plan is to publish the final code as an easy-to-use framework for simulating the aformentioned type of spiking neural networks.
